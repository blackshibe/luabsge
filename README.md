# Luabsge

Small "game engine" that integrates Lua with OpenGL.<br/>

# Problems

I HATE C++

-   fix the font rendering it's completely broken

# Cross-platform support

There is none

# Dependencies

-   glm
-   freetype2

# Installation

Glad is already in the project files rather than the build directory. <br/>
glm and glfw must be in the include path. <br/>

# Todo

Create a universal class constructor
Make creating new classes easier
